## Introduction
There are four homeworks for this course and there are simulations that we draw circuits in proteus and write code in arduino.<br>
At first Homework There are six implementation and we get to arduino and proteus and get aquinated with different sensors and actuators.<br>
At second Homework There are five implementation and we get acquainted to ```Zigbee``` and ```blynk``` which is for managing application.<br>
Thid Homework is 16 questions and there is no implementation.<br>
At fourth Homework we change source code of [MiA](https://github.com/I1820/mia) and add authorization to ```MiA```.<br>

## ðŸ’» First Homework
At this Homework, There are six implementation and we get to arduino and proteus and get aquinated with different sensors and actuators.<br>
[First Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW1/06.%20Hello%20World) is printing Firstname and Lastname.<br>
[Second Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW1/07.%20smart%20parking) is managing a ```smart parking```.<br>
[Third Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW1/08.%20smart%20bin) is manageing a ```smart bin```.<br>
[Fourth Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW1/09.%20screen%20light) is managing ```screen lights```.<br>
[Fifth Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW1/10.%20attendance%20system) is creating a system for getting list of present students in a class and getting list of absent students at the end of the class.<br>
[Sixth Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW1/11.%20smart%20greenhouse) is managing a ```smart conservatory```.<br>

## ðŸ’» Second Homework
At this Homework, There are five implementation and we get acquainted to ```Zigbee``` and ```blynk``` which is for managing application.<br>
[First Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW2/06.%20Hello_Zigbee) is transferring data between two boards through ```Zigbee``` protocol.<br>
[Second Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW2/07.%20Parking_door) is managing an ```smart parking``` by ```Zigbee``` protocol.<br>
[Third Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW2/08.%20Alarm) is manageing an alarm app by ```Zigbee``` protocol.<br>
[Fourth Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW2/09.%20Smart_home) is managing a ```smart house``` in the application site with ```blynk```.<br>
[Fifth Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW2/10.%20Security_system) is managing a ```smart security device``` in the application site with ```blynk```.<br>

## ðŸ’» Third Homework
Answer of this homework is in this [link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/blob/master/HW3/HW3_9731014.pdf).

## ðŸ’» Fourth Homework
At this Homework we change source code of [MiA](https://github.com/I1820/mia) and add some features to it and read an application for transfer data between sensors and actuators in application layer with the help of ```HTTP``` and ```MQTT``` protocols.<br>
Tasks implemented in this homework are:
> 1.  Implement Log which is sending information from agents to MiA.
> 2.  Implement Notification which is sending information from MiA to agents.
> 3.  Implement Ping in which agents send their information to MiA to make MiA know which agents are connected to MiA and get MiA the list of their things.
> 4.  Implement an authorization mechanism for authorizing agents which connects to MiA.
> 5.  Write an application which is managing four LED and one LDR and transfer data between them with the help of ```MiA```.<br>

You can access to codes of this homework by this [link](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW4).
