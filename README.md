## Introduction
There are four homeworks for this course and there are simulations that we draw circuits in proteus and write code in arduino.<br>
At first Homework There are six implementation and we get to arduino and proteus and get aquinated with different sensors and actuators.<br>
At second Homework There are five implementation and we get acquainted to zigbee and blynk which is for managing application.<br>
Thid Homework is 16 questions and there is no implementation.<br>
At fourth Homework we change source code of [MiA](https://github.com/I1820/mia) and add authorization to MiA.<br>

## ðŸ’» First Homework
At this Homework, There are six implementation and we get to arduino and proteus and get aquinated with different sensors and actuators.<br>
[First Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW1/06.%20Hello%20World) is printing Firstname and Lastname.<br>
[Second Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW1/07.%20smart%20parking) is managing a smart parking.<br>
[Third Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW1/08.%20smart%20bin) is manageing a smart bin.<br>
[Fourth Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW1/09.%20screen%20light) is managing screen lights.<br>
[Fifth Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW1/10.%20attendance%20system) is creating a system for getting list of present students in a class and getting list of absent students at the end of the class.<br>
[Sixth Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW1/11.%20smart%20greenhouse) is managing a smart conservatory.<br>

## ðŸ’» Second Homework
At this Homework, There are five implementation and we get acquainted to zigbee and blynk which is for managing application.<br>
[First Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW2/06.%20Hello_Zigbee) is transferring data between two boards through Zigbee protocol.<br>
[Second Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW2/07.%20Parking_door) is managing an smart parking by ```Zigbee``` protocol.<br>
[Third Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW2/08.%20Alarm) is manageing an alarm app by ```Zigbee``` protocol.<br>
[Fourth Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW2/09.%20Smart_home) is managing a smart house in the application site with ```blynk```.<br>
[Fifth Implementation](https://github.com/mohammadtavakoli78/Internet-of-Things/tree/master/HW2/10.%20Security_system) is managing a security device in the application site with ```blynk```.<br>
